# jSStrap

<h3></h3>jSStrap is currently the following:</h3>    
<p>A PHP web application using Bootstrap 3 and MYSQLI.</p>    
<p>The application allows you to create a database of code snippets that are sortable by language and Objective.</p>    
<p>This package contains exactly what you see here including a sample database of code snippets.<a href="http://jsstrap.com">jSStrap.com</a></p>    
<p>REQUIREMENTS:</p>    
<p>Web Server running PHP USING MYSQLI</p>    
<p>Basic Understanding of coding PHP to edit.</p>    
<p>Basic understanding of installing PHP apps to install.</p>      
<p>INSTALLATION AND SETUP</p>    
<p>Copy the files to your web server or local web accessible directory.</p>    

<p>Create a new MYSQL database called jsstart</p>    
<p>Import the codebase.sql file in the folder called sql.</p>    
<p>Open db_set.php in your favorite code editor and enter your host, database, username and password .</p>    
<p>Open index.php in your browser and everything should be identical to jsstart.com.</p>    
    
  <p>Objective: Ideally I would like to simply offer an easy way to find code snippets. But I would love to see this grow into a large database of global code that people could contribute to. If you would like to work on this project or contribute code please contact me. On Twitter I am @Enoxh. </p>
